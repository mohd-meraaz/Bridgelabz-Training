### 📅 Day 1 – Generics in Java 
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

-  Studied `Java Generics` to ensure strong compile-time type safety and eliminate explicit type casting.
-  Designed `generic classes and methods` using type parameters to improve code reusability and maintainability.
-  Applied `bounded type parameters` to logically restrict types and enforce domain-specific constraints.
-  Used `wildcards (? extends, ? super)` to build flexible, readable, and robust APIs for real-world scenarios.

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections Framework (JCF)
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

- Explored the `Java Collections Framework` to understand its purpose, structure, and overall hierarchy.
- Worked with core interfaces such as `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`, and `Map` and their common implementations.
- Compared different collection implementations based on `performance`, `ordering`, `duplication`, and `thread-safety`.
- Applied `real-world use cases and best practices` to select the most efficient collection for specific problem scenarios.

### 📅 Day 3 – Java Streams 
**(Date: 19-Jan-2026)**

- Implemented `Java I/O Streams` to handle file-based and in-memory data operations efficiently.
- Worked with `File Streams`, `Object Streams`, `ByteArray Streams`, `Buffered Streams`, and `Reader/Writer classes`.
- Understood the differences between `byte` and `character streams` for proper data handling.
- Applied key considerations and best practices for performance, buffering, and resource management.

### 📅 Day 4 – Java Exception Handling
**(Date: 20-Jan-2026)**

- Implemented comprehensive `Java Exception Handling` concepts, including `checked`, `unchecked`, and `custom exceptions`.
- Used `try-catch`, `try-catch-finally`, and `try-with-resources` for safe execution and resource management.
- Applied `throw` and `throws` for exception propagation and control flow.
- Created custom exceptions by `extending Exception` and defining constructors for meaningful `error handling`.
