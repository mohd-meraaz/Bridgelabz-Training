### 📅 Day 1 – Generics in Java 
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

-  Studied `Java Generics` to ensure strong compile-time type safety and eliminate explicit type casting.
-  Designed `generic classes and methods` using type parameters to improve code reusability and maintainability.
-  Applied `bounded type parameters` to logically restrict types and enforce domain-specific constraints.
-  Used `wildcards (? extends, ? super)` to build flexible, readable, and robust APIs for real-world scenarios.

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections Framework (JCF)
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

- Explored the `Java Collections Framework` to understand its purpose, structure, and overall hierarchy.
- Worked with core interfaces such as `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`, and `Map` and their common implementations.
- Compared different collection implementations based on `performance`, `ordering`, `duplication`, and `thread-safety`.
- Applied `real-world use cases and best practices` to select the most efficient collection for specific problem scenarios.
