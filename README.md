# 📘 Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

This week focuses on understanding and implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles using Java.

---

## 🗓 Day 1 – Classes & Objects  
**📅 26 December 2025**

- Learned the basics of **procedural programming** and its limitations.
- Studied the overview and importance of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
- Understood core Java concepts such as **Class** and **Object**.
- Practiced writing simple Java programs to create classes and instantiate objects.
- Gained clarity on how OOP helps in better code organization and reusability.

## 🗓 Day 2 – Constructors & Access Modifiers

**📅 27 December 2025**

- Learned the role of **constructors** in initializing objects and setting default values.
- Understood **access modifiers** (`public`, `protected`, `private`) and how they control data visibility.
- Practiced using **instance variables** for object-specific data and **class (static) variables** for shared data.
- Implemented **instance methods** and **static methods** to work with object-level and class-level data.
- Gained clarity on how these OOP features improve **encapsulation, code structure, and reusability**.

## 🗓 Day 3 – Java Keywords & Type Checking

**📅 29 December 2025**

- Learned the usage of the **`this` keyword** to refer to the current object and resolve variable ambiguity.
- Understood the **`static` keyword** for defining class-level variables and methods shared across objects.
- Explored the **`final` keyword** to prevent modification, method overriding, and inheritance.
- Practiced using the **`instanceof` operator** for runtime object type checking.
- Gained hands-on experience with the **Eclipse IDE** for writing, running, and debugging Java programs.

## 🗓 Day 4 – Classes, Objects & UML Diagrams

**📅 30 December 2025**

- Learned the difference between Classes and Objects in Java.
- Understood **`Class Diagrams`** to represent structure and relationships.
- Explored **`Object Diagrams`** to view object states at runtime.
- Studied **`Sequence Diagrams`** to understand object interactions and flow.
- Practiced applying **`UML diagrams`** to model real-world software systems.

## 🗓 Day 5 – Inheritance & Polymorphism in Java  
**📅 31 December 2025**

- Learned the concept of **Inheritance** and its importance in code reusability.  
- Studied **Single Level**, **Multilevel**, and **Hierarchical Inheritance** in Java.  
- Understood the **key features of inheritance** and how behavior is shared.  
- Explored **Method Overriding** and **Constructor Inheritance**.  
- Learned how **Polymorphism works with Inheritance**.  
- Studied **Access Modifiers** and their role in inheritance.

---
## 🗓 Day 6 – Encapsulation, Interfaces & Abstract Classes  
**📅 01 January 2026**

- Learned the concept of **Encapsulation** and data hiding in Java.  
- Understood **Polymorphism** and dynamic method behavior.  
- Explored **Interfaces** to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.  
- Studied **Abstract Classes** and their role in defining base behavior.
