### 📅 Day 1 – Functional Interface and Lambda Expressions
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**

- Worked with `Lambda Expressions` and `Functional Interfaces` to write concise and modern Java code:
- Understood Functional Interface (interface with only one abstract method)
- Used built-in functional interfaces:
  - `Predicate` – condition checking
  - `Consumer` – performs action without return
  - `Function` – input → output mapping
  - `Supplier` – provides values without input
- Applied lambdas with Collections for `filtering`, `sorting`, and `processing data`
- Reduced boilerplate code and improved readability
- Practised real-world scenarios using Java 8+ functional programming
- Focused on clean, expressive, and efficient Java coding using lambdas and functional interfaces.

### 📅 Day 2 – Stream API and Collectors
**(Date: 28-Jan-2026)**

- Explored Java Stream API and Collectors for powerful data processing:
- Created streams from Collections
- Used intermediate operations: `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `sorted`
- Applied terminal operations: forEach, collect, count, reduce
- Worked with Collectors:
  - `toList`, `toSet`, `toMap`
  - `groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`
  - `counting`, `averaging`, `summarising`
- Solved real-world scenarios like employee data analysis and student result processing
- Understood the benefits of functional-style, readable, and efficient data handling
- Focused on transforming, filtering, and aggregating data using Streams + Collectors for clean Java code.
