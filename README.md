# 📘 Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

This week focuses on understanding and implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles using Java.

---

## 🗓 Day 1 – Classes & Objects  
**📅 26 December 2025**

- Learned the basics of **procedural programming** and its limitations.
- Studied the overview and importance of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
- Understood core Java concepts such as **Class** and **Object**.
- Practiced writing simple Java programs to create classes and instantiate objects.
- Gained clarity on how OOP helps in better code organization and reusability.

---
## 🗓 Day 2 – Constructors & Access Modifiers

**📅 27 December 2025**

- Learned the role of **constructors** in initializing objects and setting default values.
- Understood **access modifiers** (`public`, `protected`, `private`) and how they control data visibility.
- Practiced using **instance variables** for object-specific data and **class (static) variables** for shared data.
- Implemented **instance methods** and **static methods** to work with object-level and class-level data.
- Gained clarity on how these OOP features improve **encapsulation, code structure, and reusability**.

---
## 🗓 Day 3 – Java Keywords & Type Checking

**📅 29 December 2025**

- Learned the usage of the **`this` keyword** to refer to the current object and resolve variable ambiguity.
- Understood the **`static` keyword** for defining class-level variables and methods shared across objects.
- Explored the **`final` keyword** to prevent modification, method overriding, and inheritance.
- Practiced using the **`instanceof` operator** for runtime object type checking.
- Gained hands-on experience with the **Eclipse IDE** for writing, running, and debugging Java programs.
