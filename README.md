### 📅 Day 1 – Functional Interface and Lambda Expressions
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**

- Worked with `Lambda Expressions` and `Functional Interfaces` to write concise and modern Java code:
- Understood Functional Interface (interface with only one abstract method)
- Used built-in functional interfaces:
  - `Predicate` – condition checking
  - `Consumer` – performs action without return
  - `Function` – input → output mapping
  - `Supplier` – provides values without input
- Applied lambdas with Collections for `filtering`, `sorting`, and `processing data`
- Reduced boilerplate code and improved readability
- Practised real-world scenarios using Java 8+ functional programming
- Focused on clean, expressive, and efficient Java coding using lambdas and functional interfaces.

### 📅 Day 2 – Stream API and Collectors
**(Date: 28-Jan-2026)**

- Explored Java Stream API and Collectors for powerful data processing:
- Created streams from Collections
- Used intermediate operations: `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `sorted`
- Applied terminal operations: forEach, collect, count, reduce
- Worked with Collectors:
  - `toList`, `toSet`, `toMap`
  - `groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`
  - `counting`, `averaging`, `summarising`
- Solved real-world scenarios like employee data analysis and student result processing
- Understood the benefits of functional-style, readable, and efficient data handling
- Focused on transforming, filtering, and aggregating data using Streams + Collectors for clean Java code.

### 📅 Day 3 – Java 8 Scenario-Based Questions Practice
**(Date: 29-30 Jan 2026)**

- Practised a wide range of scenario-based problems using Java 8 features to understand how functional programming concepts are applied in real-world applications.
- The focus was on writing clean, readable, and efficient code while replacing traditional imperative logic with modern Java constructs.

**Topics Practised in Detail**

- `Lambda Expressions` - Used to simplify anonymous classes and concisely implement behaviour-driven logic.
- `Functional Interfaces` - Practised built-in interfaces such as Predicate, Function, Consumer, and Supplier to model business rules.
- `Streams API` - Solved problems involving filtering, mapping, grouping, sorting, and aggregation of collections.
- `Optional Class` - Handled null-sensitive scenarios safely and avoided NullPointerException using Optional-based design.

### 📅 Day 4 – Java 8 Logical Questions Practice
**(Date: 31-Jan-2026)**

- Java 8 `List → Map`, `Map → List`, `List ↔ Set`, and `Array ↔ Collection` conversions using Streams.
- Object collection transformations and grouping scenarios with Java 8 Streams.
- String-based logical problems such as `frequency count`, `filtering`, and `character processing` using streams.
- Stream logical questions involving `filtering`, `mapping`, `sorting`, `grouping`, `partitioning`, and `reduction`.
- Lambda Expressions, Functional Interfaces, Optional class, and Streams API applied in interview-oriented scenarios.
