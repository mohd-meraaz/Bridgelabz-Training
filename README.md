### 📅 Day 1 – Generics in Java 
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

-  Studied `Java Generics` to ensure strong compile-time type safety and eliminate explicit type casting.
-  Designed `generic classes and methods` using type parameters to improve code reusability and maintainability.
-  Applied `bounded type parameters` to logically restrict types and enforce domain-specific constraints.
-  Used `wildcards (? extends, ? super)` to build flexible, readable, and robust APIs for real-world scenarios.

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections Framework (JCF)
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

- Explored the `Java Collections Framework` to understand its purpose, structure, and overall hierarchy.
- Worked with core interfaces such as `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`, and `Map` and their common implementations.
- Compared different collection implementations based on `performance`, `ordering`, `duplication`, and `thread-safety`.
- Applied `real-world use cases and best practices` to select the most efficient collection for specific problem scenarios.

### 📅 Day 3 – Java Streams 
**(Date: 19-Jan-2026)**

- Implemented `Java I/O Streams` to handle file-based and in-memory data operations efficiently.
- Worked with `File Streams`, `Object Streams`, `ByteArray Streams`, `Buffered Streams`, and `Reader/Writer classes`.
- Understood the differences between `byte` and `character streams` for proper data handling.
- Applied key considerations and best practices for performance, buffering, and resource management.

### 📅 Day 4 – Java Exception Handling
**(Date: 20-Jan-2026)**

- Implemented comprehensive `Java Exception Handling` concepts, including `checked`, `unchecked`, and `custom exceptions`.
- Used `try-catch`, `try-catch-finally`, and `try-with-resources` for safe execution and resource management.
- Applied `throw` and `throws` for exception propagation and control flow.
- Created custom exceptions by `extending Exception` and defining constructors for meaningful `error handling`.

### 📅 Day 5 – Regular Expressions (regex) and JUnit
**(Date: 21-Jan-2026)**

- Learned and practised Regex concepts, including `metacharacters`, `quantifiers`, and writing patterns for `email validation`, `password strength`, and `phone number formats`.
- Worked with the `Java Regex API` using `Pattern` and `Matcher`, and practised methods like `find()`, `matches()`, and `replaceAll()`.
- Learned the JUnit framework for `unit testing in Java` and understood its role in testing application logic.
- Practised writing `JUnit test cases` using `annotations`, proper test class structure, and `assertions` to verify results.

### 📅 Day 6 – Annotations and Reflection in Java
**(Date: 22-Jan-2026)**

- Learned the basics of annotations in Java and understood their purpose in adding `metadata` to code.
- Practised using common `built-in annotations` and created `custom and advanced annotations` for real-world scenarios.
- Explored real-world use cases of annotations and how they are handled using annotation processing tools.
- Gained understanding of `Java Reflection`, practised `accessing classes`, `methods`, and `fields` at runtime, and used reflection with annotations.
