### 📅 Day 1 – Functional Interface and Lambda Expressions
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**

- Worked with `Lambda Expressions` and `Functional Interfaces` to write concise and modern Java code:
- Understood Functional Interface (interface with only one abstract method)
- Used built-in functional interfaces:
  - `Predicate` – condition checking
  - `Consumer` – performs action without return
  - `Function` – input → output mapping
  - `Supplier` – provides values without input
- Applied lambdas with Collections for `filtering`, `sorting`, and `processing data`
- Reduced boilerplate code and improved readability
- Practised real-world scenarios using Java 8+ functional programming
- Focused on clean, expressive, and efficient Java coding using lambdas and functional interfaces.
